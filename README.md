# Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Term 2
# Project #3: Particle Filter

## Introduction
This is a project for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. It implements an Particle Filter to estimate a car's state based on laser measurements.


## Concepts and Classes
Concepts explored in this project:

  - Particle Filters
  - Sensor fusion
  - Non-linear process models like CTRV (Constant Turn Rate and Velocity)

Relevant classes:

  - [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs373)

## Getting Started
Code is stored in the `src` directory.

To run the code, execute the following in the top level directory:

`./clean.sh`

`./build.sh`

`./run.sh`
